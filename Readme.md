# Future Climatology Changes of Cities within Different Climate Zones

## Scientific Question

With accelerating global climate change, city climatologies are gradually shifting. The most widely used climate zone classification is the Köppen-Geiger system, which divide climate into 5 main classes and 30 sub-types. However, Köppen-Geiger classification only takes air temperature and precipitation as indexes for thresold formulation, which is rather simplified considering the multifacets of city climatology. There are previous studies which projected future Köppen-Geiger zone change based on air temperature and precipitation data, but how changes in additional factors, such as humidity (humid heat, which is more dangerous for human physiological well-being), (compound) extreme events, and fluctuation in weather patterns ("wonkiness") are contributing to city climatology changes remain largely unexplored. Therefore, this project aims to address these gaps by investigating three primary research questions:

1) What are the impacts of humidity on future heat stress compared to current days for cities in different climate zones?
2) How will the frequency and intensity of future extreme events change, and whether there's strong heterogeneity among cities in distinct climate zones?
3) Will monthly and seasonal weather conditions in the future become more variable and the "wonkiness" of city climatology significantly increase acorss various climate zones?

## Analysis

1) Impact of Humidity on Heat Stress  
   Select six cities representative of distinct climate zones, calculate and compare the heat wave index (total days with t_max exceeding 95% percentile of climatology) as well as humid heat wave index of current climate (1991-2020) and future climate (2071-2100).

2) Frequency and Risks of Extreme Events  
   Utilize heat wave index, Rx5day, CDD (Consecutive Dry Days) to explore future extreme events frequency change, and carry out correlation analysis between different climate drivers (evapotranspiration, temperature, precipitation) to evaluate the risks of potential compound hazards.

3) “Wonkiness” and Instability of City Climatology  
   Calculate the standard deviation, monthly range, and autocorrelation within the month of air temperature and precipitation to reflect the future change of city climate wonkiness and instability across different climate zones.

## Outcomes

1) Humidity’s Role in Future Heat Stress  
   Determine whether humidity will aggravate or cushion future heat stress in cities within different climate zones, providing insights into regional vulnerabilities.

2) Changes in Extreme Event Frequency and Impact  
   Clarify to what extent future frequency and intensity of extreme event will increase, particularly for cities where dramatic shifts might occur.

3) "Wonkiness" of Future Climate  
   Illustrate projected changes in climate wonkiness, helping to communicate how shifts in monthly and seasonal weather stability will affect the lived experiences in cities with varying climate zone classifications.
